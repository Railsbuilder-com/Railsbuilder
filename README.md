# Railsbuilder

Railsbuilder is an open source Rails application that makes it easy to build and manage websites. It's still a work in progress and **not production-ready yet** – but it's designed as a flexible foundation for creating modern, user-friendly websites.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

Railsbuilder is currently under development. It’s not finished, but the goal is clear: to provide a powerful yet simple website builder that anyone can use and extend.

The project is open to contributions. Whether you want to add new features, fix bugs, improve documentation, or suggest ideas – your input is more than welcome!

## 🔍 What is Railsbuilder?

Railsbuilder is a customizable and developer-friendly website builder built in Ruby on Rails. It lets you create and manage pages, content blocks, and layouts through a clean admin interface – without touching code (unless you want to).

It’s a great starting point for developers who want to build a no-code/low-code site editor, or need a flexible CMS-style solution.
